# Rat-Behavior
Project analyzing rat whisking behaviour in different contexts

Data and Analysis files used for the paper:
Predictive whisker kinematics reveal context-dependent sensorimotor strategies
by Avner Wallach, David Deutsch, Tess Oram and Ehud Ahissar

Instructions:
1. go to the 'Generate Database' folder and run 'generate_database.m' in matlab. This function reads the 3 datasets
   and extracts whisking, head and pumping data.
2. go to the 'Analysis' folder and run any of the functions to generate the figures appearing in the paper.
